                JSON = JavaScript Object Notation.<br>
                It is the way of easier handling information within JS by pairing it all
                within key/value, even if the value is set to have other key/value pairs.

                Express is a framework for easier managing your Web Application as if it
                was build with the MVC structure.<br>
                You can implement a real MVC structure by using a real database
                but Express is helping you organise and getting ready for that.<br>
                Express also helps you save an insane amount of redundant code.<br>

                Here you're not sending any information to the new page, just opening it<br>
                POST - is used when you're sending data to a different page.<br>
                Here you're both opening the new page and also sending some data over to the new page, so it can be<br>
                handled for some specific purpose.

                Cascating Style Sheets is a way to gather the styling same group of objects.<br>
                This way you dont need to to every single button, paragraph or other tags inline and remembering
                which styling you used where, all you need is to remember which class or id the object belongs to.

                If this wasnt run I would need to create a package.json and then insert the needed information,
                such as which dependency (Express) and what version of the dependency should be running.

                It keeps watch over the application files and automatically restarts the application.
